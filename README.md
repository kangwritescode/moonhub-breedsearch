# BreedSearch

[BreedSearch](https://breed-search.vercel.app/) is a simplified, user-friendly, and intuitive version of the application example for Moonhub’s take-home assessment.

It provides an interface for building a boolean search expression, and allows the user to execute the built expression and view the search results in a table (of dogs!).

## Running Locally

Navigate to the root directory using your preferred command line and run the following command to install and spin up a local development server:

    npm install && npm run dev
    
## User Instructions
BreedSearch is intuitively designed, and should be easy to figure out by playing with it. 

Simply enter a dog attribute in the input, click a boolean expression block, and click one of colored tags in order to add it to the selected boolean expression.

To remove an attribute from a block, simply click it. To remove a boolean expression block, click it twice sequentially.

Click the search button to view a table of the dogs that match your query!
